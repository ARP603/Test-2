  "server.type.paper.description": "Highly optimized server type built for stability and performance on large, public servers. It supports plugins (e.g., EssentialsX, WorldEdit, or mini-game additions) which add commands, economy, or manage server functionality. Players do not need to install anything extra to join. It does not support traditional Minecraft mods, but it can be used alongside GeyserMC (https://geysermc.org/) to support crossplay with Minecraft Bedrock.",
  "server.type.fabric.description": "Lightweight and fast server type -- best for a small, vanilla-style modpack or servers focused on performance optimization mods (e.g., Lithium). It is often one of the first to update after a new Minecraft release. To join, players must install the Fabric mod loader and the same mods on their game client. It does not support plugins.",
  "server.type.forge.description": "The classic and most common server type for heavily modded Minecraft. It supports a vast library of complex mods that can add new blocks, items, machines, magic, and entire dimensions (used by large modpacks like FTB, RLCraft, or SkyFactory). To join a Forge server, players must install the Forge mod loader and the same mods on their game client. It does not support plugins."
